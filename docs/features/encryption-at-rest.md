# Feature: Encryption at Rest

> Last updated: 2026-04-08

## Context

Picsou stores sensitive credentials in PostgreSQL: crypto exchange API keys/secrets, Trade Republic session/refresh tokens, and bank sync session IDs. A database compromise (backup leak, SQL injection, host access) would expose these credentials, granting attackers access to financial accounts. All sensitive fields are encrypted at the application layer using AES-256-GCM before storage.

## How it works

### CryptoEncryption component

`CryptoEncryption` is a Spring `@Component` that provides `encrypt(plainText)` and `decrypt(cipherText)` methods. It is injected into any service that handles sensitive credentials.

- **Algorithm**: `AES/GCM/NoPadding` -- authenticated encryption (confidentiality + integrity)
- **IV**: 12-byte random IV generated per encryption call
- **Tag**: 128-bit GCM authentication tag (tamper detection)
- **Storage format**: `Base64(IV || ciphertext || tag)` -- single string stored in VARCHAR columns
- **Key**: 256-bit symmetric key from `CRYPTO_ENCRYPTION_KEY` env var (Base64-encoded)
- **Startup behavior**: The application **refuses to start** if the key is not set. No plaintext fallback.

### What is encrypted

| Data | Entity | Column | Encrypted since |
|------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Crypto exchange API key | `CryptoExchangeSession` | `api_key` | V15 (2026-04-08) |
| Crypto exchange API secret | `CryptoExchangeSession` | `api_secret` | V9 (initial) |
| Trade Republic session token | `TradeRepublicSession` | `session_token` | V15 (2026-04-08) |
| Trade Republic refresh token | `TradeRepublicSession` | `refresh_token` | V15 (2026-04-08) |

### What is NOT encrypted (and why)

- **Bank sync session IDs** (`requisition.requisition_id`): These are opaque references to Enable Banking sessions, not credentials. They cannot be reused to initiate new bank connections.
- **Wallet addresses**: Public blockchain data by nature.
- **User password**: BCrypt-hashed (not encrypted) -- correct approach for passwords.
- **Finary credentials**: Stored in environment variables, not in the database. Out of scope for DB-level encryption.

### Key files

- `config/CryptoEncryption.java` -- AES-256-GCM encrypt/decrypt, key validation at startup
- `service/CryptoExchangeSyncService.java` -- Encrypts apiKey + apiSecret on store, decrypts on read
- `service/TradeRepublicSyncService.java` -- Encrypts session/refresh tokens on store, decrypts on read
- `db/migration/V15__widen_encrypted_columns.sql` -- Widens columns for encrypted values, truncates legacy plaintext

### Flow

```
Store credential:
  plainText --> CryptoEncryption.encrypt()
                  |
                  v
                generate random 12-byte IV
                  |
                  v
                AES-GCM encrypt with IV + key --> ciphertext + tag
                  |
                  v
                Base64(IV || ciphertext || tag) --> VARCHAR column

Read credential:
  VARCHAR column --> CryptoEncryption.decrypt()
                       |
                       v
                     Base64 decode --> IV || ciphertext || tag
                       |
                       v
                     AES-GCM decrypt with IV + key --> plainText
```

## Technical choices

| Choice | Why | Rejected alternative |
|--------|-----|----------------------|
| Application-level encryption | Granular, works with any PostgreSQL, protects against DB dumps | pgcrypto (key in SQL), LUKS (only protects against disk theft) |
| AES-256-GCM | Authenticated encryption, standard, no padding oracle | AES-CBC (no integrity check), ChaCha20 (less Java support) |
| Mandatory key at startup | Prevents silent plaintext storage in misconfigured deployments | Optional key with warning (easy to miss, critical for finance app) |
| Truncate legacy data in V15 | Clean break; old plaintext values cannot be decrypted by new code | Graceful migration (complex, needs key in SQL migration) |
| Single shared key | Simple; sufficient for single-user self-hosted app | Per-field or per-entity keys (unnecessary complexity) |

## Gotchas / Pitfalls

- **Key is mandatory**: The app will not start without `CRYPTO_ENCRYPTION_KEY`. Generate with: `openssl rand -base64 32`.
- **Lost key = re-enter credentials**: If the encryption key is lost, encrypted data cannot be recovered. The user must re-add crypto exchanges and re-authenticate Trade Republic.
- **V15 truncates existing sessions**: After deploying V15, all crypto exchange sessions and TR sessions are cleared. Users must re-enter API keys and re-authenticate TR. This is a one-time migration cost.
- **Column widths**: Encrypted values are ~1.4x larger than plaintext (Base64 overhead + 12-byte IV + 16-byte tag). Columns are sized with headroom: `api_key` 500, `api_secret` 500, `session_token` 2000, `refresh_token` 4000.
- **No key rotation**: A single key is used for all encryption. If compromised, all secrets must be re-encrypted. No versioning mechanism exists yet.
- **Decryption failure on corrupt data**: If a stored value is not valid AES-GCM ciphertext (e.g., legacy plaintext), `decrypt()` throws `RuntimeException`. Callers should handle this gracefully (crypto sync sets status to ERROR; TR treats it as expired session).

## Tests

- No dedicated tests for the encryption-at-rest integration (CryptoEncryption is tested via `CryptoEncryptionTest` for roundtrip correctness)
- Manual verification: add an exchange, inspect the `api_key` and `api_secret` columns in the database -- both should be Base64 strings, not readable keys

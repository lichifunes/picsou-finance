# Feature: Crypto Tracking

> Last updated: 2026-04-08

## Context

Picsou tracks cryptocurrency holdings from two sources: centralized exchanges (Binance) and on-chain wallets (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana). Exchange credentials are encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM. On-chain wallets query public blockchain RPCs. All crypto balances are converted to EUR via the `PriceService`.

## How it works

### Three subsystems

1. **CryptoExchangeSyncService** -- Manages exchange connections. Stores encrypted API key + encrypted secret in `CryptoExchangeSession`. Both fields are encrypted with AES-256-GCM. Fetches holdings, converts to EUR via `PriceService.refreshPrices()`, and upserts a single account per exchange with per-coin holdings in `AccountHolding`.

2. **WalletSyncService** -- Manages on-chain wallet addresses. Stores chain type + address in `WalletAddress`. Fetches native balance via `WalletPort`, converts to EUR, and upserts an account. Does NOT store a ticker on the account to prevent double price conversion (balance is already in EUR).

3. **PriceService** -- Provides EUR prices for crypto tickers via CoinGecko. See [price-service.md](./price-service.md).

### AES-256-GCM encryption

`CryptoEncryption` handles encryption/decryption of API keys and secrets stored in the database. Both `apiKey` and `apiSecret` are encrypted. It uses `AES/GCM/NoPadding` with a 12-byte IV and 128-bit tag. The IV is prepended to the ciphertext before Base64 encoding. The encryption key is provided via the `CRYPTO_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable (Base64-encoded 256-bit key). The app **refuses to start** if the key is not set. See [encryption-at-rest.md](./encryption-at-rest.md) for full details.

### Binance adapter

`BinanceAdapter` implements `CryptoExchangePort`. It calls the Binance REST API (`GET /api/v3/account`) with HMAC-SHA256 signed requests. Returns a list of `CryptoHolding` records for all assets with non-zero balances (free + locked). The `testConnection()` method validates credentials before saving.

### Bitcoin wallet adapter

`BitcoinWalletAdapter` implements `WalletPort`. It supports three input formats for the address field:

- **Plain address** (`bc1q...`, `1...`, `3...`) -- Single address lookup via Blockstream Esplora API.
- **Extended public key** (`xpub...`, `zpub...`) -- BIP32 HD wallet key derivation. Derives P2WPKH addresses (BIP84) along external (`m/0/*`) and change (`m/1/*`) chains.
- **Output descriptor** (`wpkh([fingerprint/path]xpub.../chain/*)#checksum`) -- Proton Wallet format, normalized to xpub before derivation.

The adapter scans each chain until `GAP_LIMIT` (20) consecutive unused addresses are found (BIP44 standard). `BitcoinKeyUtils` provides BIP32 key derivation, Base58Check decoding, and Bech32 encoding.

### Ethereum wallet adapter

`EthereumWalletAdapter` calls `eth_getBalance` on the Cloudflare Ethereum RPC (`cloudflare-eth.com`). Returns balance converted from wei to ETH (18 decimals).

### Solana wallet adapter

`SolanaWalletAdapter` calls `getBalance` on the Solana mainnet RPC (`api.mainnet-beta.solana.com`). Returns balance converted from lamports to SOL (9 decimals).

### Key files

- `service/CryptoExchangeSyncService.java` -- Exchange connection management, holding sync
- `service/WalletSyncService.java` -- On-chain wallet management, balance sync
- `config/CryptoEncryption.java` -- AES-256-GCM encrypt/decrypt for API secrets
- `adapter/BinanceAdapter.java` -- Binance REST API with HMAC-SHA256
- `adapter/BitcoinWalletAdapter.java` -- Blockstream Esplora, BIP32 key derivation
- `adapter/EthereumWalletAdapter.java` -- Cloudflare ETH RPC
- `adapter/SolanaWalletAdapter.java` -- Solana mainnet RPC
- `adapter/util/BitcoinKeyUtils.java` -- BIP32 derivation, Base58Check, Bech32
- `port/CryptoExchangePort.java` -- Exchange port interface
- `port/WalletPort.java` -- Wallet port interface

### Flow

```
Add Exchange:
User submits API key + secret
        |
        v
CryptoExchangeSyncService.addExchange()
        |
        v
BinanceAdapter.testConnection() -- validate credentials
        |
        v
CryptoEncryption.encrypt(key + secret) -- AES-256-GCM
        |
        v
Save CryptoExchangeSession (encryptedKey + encryptedSecret)
        |
        v
BinanceAdapter.fetchHoldings() -- get balances
        |
        v
PriceService.refreshPrices() -- convert to EUR
        |
        v
Upsert Account (type=CRYPTO) + AccountHolding per coin

Add Wallet:
User submits chain + address
        |
        v
WalletSyncService.addWallet()
        |
        v
WalletPort.fetchBalance() -- blockchain RPC call
        |
        v
PriceService.getPriceEur() -- convert native to EUR
        |
        v
Upsert Account (type=CRYPTO, no ticker)
```

## Technical choices

| Choice | Why | Rejected alternative |
|--------|-----|----------------------|
| AES-256-GCM (symmetric) | Simple, no external dependency; sufficient for single-user self-hosted app | HashiCorp Vault, cloud KMS (overkill for self-hosted) |
| No ticker on wallet accounts | Balance is already converted to EUR at sync time; storing a ticker would cause `PriceService.toEur()` to multiply a second time | Store ticker and handle conversion in dashboard (risk of double conversion) |
| BIP32 key derivation in Java | Full control over derivation; no native library dependency | Use a separate Bitcoin library (unnecessary complexity) |
| Blockstream Esplora (public) | Free, no API key needed, reliable | Run own Electrum server (too much for self-hosted) |
| GAP_LIMIT=20 | BIP44 standard; covers the vast majority of HD wallets | Custom gap limit (not configurable, hardcoded) |

## Gotchas / Pitfalls

- **CRYPTO_ENCRYPTION_KEY required**: The app refuses to start without it. Lost key = cannot decrypt existing secrets = must re-enter exchange credentials.
- **No ticker on wallet accounts**: Wallet accounts have `ticker = null` and `provider = "BTC"/"ETH"/"SOL"`. The balance is already in EUR. Do not set a ticker on wallet accounts -- it will cause double price conversion.
- **Bitcoin xpub vs zpub**: Both are supported. `BitcoinKeyUtils.normalizeToXpub()` converts zpub to xpub before derivation. The derivation always produces P2WPKH (native segwit) addresses.
- **Output descriptor parsing**: Descriptors are parsed by extracting the xpub between brackets. The checksum after `#` is ignored. Complex descriptors (multisig, P2SH-wrapped) are not supported.
- **Exchange holdings use PriceService**: Holdings are converted to EUR at sync time using `PriceService.refreshPrices()`. If the price cache is stale (older than 15 min), prices are refreshed on demand.

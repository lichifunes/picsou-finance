# Feature: Goals

> Last updated: 2026-05-29 (history backfill before goal creation + avg manual-contribution fallback)

## Context

Picsou lets users define savings goals with a target amount and deadline. Goals are linked to one or more accounts (M:N relationship). Progress is computed from the current balances of linked accounts compared to the target. Monthly tracking shows how much has been saved each month versus how much is needed, with optional per-month overrides.

## How it works

### Goal-Account relationship

A `Goal` has a M:N relationship with `Account` via the `goal_account` join table. An account can belong to multiple goals, and a goal can have multiple accounts. When progress is calculated, the balances of all linked accounts are summed.

### Progress calculation

`GoalService.toProgressResponse()` computes:

- **currentTotal**: Sum of `liveBalanceEur()` across all linked accounts. For holding accounts, this uses live prices from `PriceService` (with PnL). For cash accounts, falls back to stored balance converted to EUR.
- **percentComplete**: `(currentTotal / targetAmount) * 100`, rounded to 4 decimal places.
- **monthsLeft**: `ChronoUnit.MONTHS.between(today, deadline)`, minimum 0.
- **monthlyNeeded**: `(target - currentTotal) / monthsLeft`. If deadline has passed, the entire remaining amount is the monthly need.
- **avgMonthlyContribution**: Average monthly balance increase over the last 3 months across all linked accounts, computed from `BalanceSnapshot` history. **Fallback for manually-tracked goals**: when no linked account has snapshot data (`accountsWithData == 0`), the average is computed from the recorded `GoalManualContribution` entries instead (sum ÷ count), so backfilled manual history refines the figure. Returns `null` only when neither source has data. Displayed in the UI but no longer drives `isOnTrack`.
- **isOnTrack**: `Σ effective(past months) >= Σ objective(past months)`. `effective` = `manualActual ?? snapshot-delta` (months with neither are skipped). `objective` = `override ?? monthlyNeeded`. "Past" = strictly before the current month (current month is in progress). Returns `true` when the goal has no `createdAt`, no past month, or no past month with data (benefit of the doubt).

### Monthly tracking

`GoalService.getMonthlyEntries()` generates a month-by-month breakdown from the *effective start month* to the deadline. The effective start is the goal's `createdAt` month, unless `Goal.historyStartMonth` is set to an earlier month (see **History backfill** below). For each month:

- **objective**: The auto-computed `monthlyNeeded`.
- **actual**: The real balance delta for that month (from snapshots: end-of-month balance minus end-of-previous-month balance). `null` for future months.
- **manualActual**: A manually entered contribution amount (from `GoalManualContribution`). Takes precedence over computed actual.
- **override**: A per-month override for the objective (from `GoalMonthOverride`). Stored but tracked alongside the auto-computed value.
- **effective**: `manualActual` if set, otherwise `actual`.

### Overrides and manual contributions

Two separate override mechanisms:

- **GoalMonthOverride**: Overrides the monthly savings *objective* for a specific month. Useful when the user plans to save more or less than the computed target.
- **GoalManualContribution**: Overrides the monthly savings *actual* for a specific month. Useful when the user wants to track contributions that don't appear in account balances (e.g. cash savings).

### History backfill (before goal creation)

Users often start a goal in Picsou after they've already been saving for it. The backfill feature lets them extend the calendar *earlier* than the goal's creation date so they can record that prior history (typically as manual contributions).

- **`Goal.historyStartMonth`** (`VARCHAR(7)`, nullable, format `"YYYY-MM"`): when set and earlier than the `createdAt` month, the monthly calendar starts from this month. `null` keeps the default (`createdAt`-derived) start. Added in migration `V32__goal_history_start.sql`.
- **`GoalService.effectiveStartMonth(goal)`**: returns `min(createdAt month, historyStartMonth)` — the single source of truth for where the calendar begins.
- **`POST /api/goals/{id}/history/extend`** → `GoalService.extendHistory()`: decrements the effective start by one year and persists it as the new `historyStartMonth`. The frontend exposes this via a slim "+ Add {year}" card above the calendar (`useExtendGoalHistory`), where `year = earliestRenderedYear - 1`.
- Backfilled months have no snapshot data, so they render empty until the user fills them in manually.
- **`isOnTrack` is deliberately NOT affected by backfill**: it stays anchored to `createdAt` (`isOnTrackFromPastMonths` is unchanged). Backfill is history-only — when actuals come from linked accounts, extending the window backwards must not retroactively change the "on track" verdict. Backfilled manual contributions *do* feed `avgMonthlyContribution` (see above), refining the "average monthly" figure for manually-tracked goals.

### Flow

```
Create goal (name, targetAmount, deadline, accountIds)
        |
        v
GoalService.create() --> save Goal with linked accounts
        |
        v
GoalService.toProgressResponse()
        |
        +-- sum liveBalanceEur() per account --> currentTotal
        +-- compute monthsLeft, monthlyNeeded
        +-- calculateAvgMonthlyContribution() from snapshots
        +-- determine isOnTrack
        |
        v
Get monthly entries:
        |
        v
GoalService.getMonthlyEntries(goalId)
        |
        +-- for each month from creation to deadline:
        |       +-- calculateActualForMonth() from snapshots
        |       +-- lookup GoalManualContribution
        |       +-- lookup GoalMonthOverride
        |       +-- build GoalMonthEntryResponse
        |
        v
Set month override:
GoalService.setMonthOverride(goalId, yearMonth, amount)
        --> upsert GoalMonthOverride
        --> return updated entry
```

## Technical choices

| Choice | Why | Rejected alternative |
|--------|-----|----------------------|
| M:N goal-account relationship | A savings goal often spans multiple accounts (checking + savings + PEA) | One account per goal (too restrictive) |
| Snapshot-based actual calculation | Uses existing BalanceSnapshot data; no need for a separate transaction import | Dedicated savings transaction table |
| Separate override + manual contribution | Different semantics: override changes the target, manual contribution changes the actual | Single override field (loses information) |
| 3-month average for `avgMonthlyContribution` | Short enough to reflect recent behavior, long enough to smooth out noise | 6-month or 12-month average (too slow to reflect changes) |
| `isOnTrack` from cumulative past months | Single source of truth with the `/goals/:id/calendar` view; lets the user influence the badge indirectly via overrides + manual contributions | Snapshot-based 3-month average (decoupled from what the calendar shows; could not be influenced by user adjustments) |
| `null` for no history | Distinguishes "no data yet" from "zero contribution"; `isOnTrack` treats null as "benefit of the doubt" | Return zero (would mark new goals as "not on track") |
| `liveBalanceEur()` for currentTotal | Holding accounts show real portfolio value with PnL, not stale sync-time balance | `AccountResponse.currentBalanceEur` (does not reflect live prices) |
| `<Badge variant="secondary">` for account chips | Uses theme semantic tokens (luma preset); consistent with rest of the UI | Per-account pastel `<span>` with `style={{ background: a.color }}` |
| `<Badge variant="default">` for achieved/on track status | Solid primary color; visible and unambiguous | Pastel `bg-green-500/10` (barely visible, not theme-aware) |

## Gotchas / Pitfalls

- **Accounts can belong to multiple goals**: If an account is linked to two goals, its full balance counts toward both goals' `currentTotal`. There is no "partial allocation."
- **Monthly actual is computed from snapshots, not transactions**: The actual savings for a month is the delta between end-of-month snapshot balances. If snapshots are missing (e.g. new account, no sync), that month will have `null` actual.
- **Override does not recalculate monthlyNeeded**: Setting a month override changes the display value for that month but does not affect the computed `monthlyNeeded`. The auto-computed objective is always based on `(target - current) / monthsLeft`.
- **Effective-start to deadline range**: `getMonthlyEntries()` iterates from the effective start month (`min(createdAt, historyStartMonth)`) to the deadline month. If the goal was created mid-month, the first month's actual may be partial. Backfilled months (before `createdAt`) never have snapshot data.
- **`findAllWithAccounts()` uses a custom query**: Goals are fetched with their accounts eagerly loaded to avoid N+1 queries during progress calculation.

## Tests

- `GoalServiceTest` -- unit tests for progress calculation, monthly entries, overrides, edge cases (deadline passed, no history)

## Frontend notes

- **Account chips** use `<Badge variant="secondary">` — theme-aware, no per-account color. The `ACCOUNT_COLORS` palette is still used elsewhere (ColorPicker, DistributionPie, AccountCard, FinaryTab) but not in goal cards.
- **Status badges**: achieved/on track use `variant="default"` (primary), behind uses `variant="destructive"`, waiting uses `variant="secondary"`.
- **Calendar badges**: "manu." uses `variant="secondary"`, "modif." uses `variant="outline"` — no raw Tailwind color overrides.
- **Icons**: `TrendingUp`/`TrendingDown` come from `lucide-react` (not HugeIcons) in the goals pages.
- **Goal detail chart**: `GoalDetailModal` reuses the shared `NetWorthChart` with the optional `target`, `projection`, and `todayMs` props. The chart draws:
  - A dashed `var(--chart-3)` ideal trajectory from `(goal.createdAt, balanceAtCreation)` to `(goal.deadline, goal.targetAmount)`, where `balanceAtCreation` is the first history point at or after `goal.createdAt`. Using the baseline (not zero) keeps the trajectory in the same reference frame as the live area, so the visual matches the "behind/on track" badge.
  - A dotted `var(--muted-foreground)` "at current pace" projection from `(today, currentTotal)` to `(goal.deadline, currentTotal + avgMonthlyContribution * monthsLeft)`, rendered as an `Area` with a faint left→right gradient so the chart fades into the future rather than cutting net at today. Skipped when `avgMonthlyContribution` is null (no history yet).
  - A vertical "today" reference line marking the boundary between past data and future projection. Only drawn when a target/projection extends past the data.
  - When `target` is set, history is cropped on the left to `target.startDate`. On the `ALL` range, the X axis is stretched right up to the deadline so the projection beyond today is visible.
  - The goal modal passes `showInvested={false}` to declutter the legend (capital-invested is irrelevant for a savings goal).
  - The `target`/`projection`/`todayMs` props are opt-in: Dashboard / Accounts / AccountDetail don't pass them and remain unchanged.
